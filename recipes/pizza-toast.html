    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A simple toast covered with melty cheese toppings has been making the
      <br />
      rounds on social media, but it's not just a slice of bread with some\
      <br />
      cheese melted on top. To give this toast the "lava" in its name, you
      <br />
      actually stack two pieces of toast together to make a combination of
      <br />
      grilled cheese and pizza toast.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
      <li>2 slices sourdough bread</li>
      <li>1 ½ ounces sliced mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 ounce sliced pepper jack cheese</li>
      <li>5 slices pickled jalapeno</li>
      <li>5 slices pepperoni</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon pizza sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon italian seasoning, divided</li>
      <li>Crushed red pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>Ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Spread
        <br />
        butter on both sides of each slice of bread and place on the prepared
        <br />
        pan. Bake, flipping once halfway through, until bread is lightly browned
        <br />
        on both sides, about 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the perimeter of one bread slice with half of the mozzarella
        <br />
        cheese, leaving the middle part of the bread empty. Top with other slice
        <br />
        of bread. Use the back of a spoon to make an indentation in the middle
        <br />
        of the bread slices, pushing down firmly to reach the bottom slice. Add
        <br />
        the pizza sauce to the indentation, and sprinkle half the Italian
        <br />
        seasoning over the top. Cover with remaining ½ ounce mozzarella cheese
        <br />
        and pepper jack, followed by jalapeño and pepperoni. Garnish with
        <br />
        remaining Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until the cheese is melted and golden-brown, about 5 minutes.
        <br />
        Slice in half and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
