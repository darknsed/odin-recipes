    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This bang bang chicken casserole is an all-in-one chicken and rice dish
      <br />
      topped with a bang bang sauce inspired by Bonefish Grill's iconic Bang
      <br />
      Bang Shrimp. Spiced and sauteed chicken baked over rice in a single
      <br />
      skillet minimizes hands-on time, and results in a spicy, savory dish with
      <br />
      a hint of sweetness.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss together chicken, onion powder, 2 tablespoons Sriracha, 2
        <br />
        tablespoons soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon garlic until well combined in a
        <br />
        large bowl. Sprinkle with flour until completely coated.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until
        <br />
        shimmering. Working in 2 batches, add chicken in an even layer; cook,
        <br />
        undisturbed, until browned on both sides, about 6 minutes total,
        <br />
        flipping halfway through. Transfer chicken to a plate. Do not wipe
        <br />
        skillet clean. Repeat with remaining chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium and stir in rice, 2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce,
        <br />
        1 1/2 teaspoons rice vinegar, remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and
        <br />
        remaining 1 tablespoon garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
        <br />
        fragrant and rice is toasted, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in broth and bring to a boil over medium-high. Remove from heat and
        <br />
        top evenly with chicken. Cover with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum
        <br />
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until rice is tender and cooked through, 22
        to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, whisk together mayonnaise, remaining 1/4 cup sweet chili
        <br />
        sauce, 2 tablespoons Sriracha, and 1 1/2 teaspoons rice vinegar until
        <br />
        smooth. Transfer to a squeeze bottle, or transfer to a resealable
        <br />
        plastic bag, reseal the bag, and cut off a small corner.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle casserole with bang bang sauce as desired. Garnish with
        scallions and sesame seeds.
