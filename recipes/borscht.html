    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe is a family version of classic borscht, which is naturally
      <br />
      meatless (though it uses chicken broth for flavor) and packed with
      <br />
      vegetables like beets, carrots, and potatoes. It takes about 1 hour and 10
      <br />
      minutes to make and yields 10 servings. The recipe suggests serving it
      <br />
      with a dollop of sour cream or real mayo.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel, grate and/or slice all vegetables (keeping sliced potatoes in cold

        While potatoes are cooking, place a large skillet over medium/high heat
        <br />
        and add 2 Tbsp oil. Add chopped onion, celery and bell pepper. Saute
        <br />
